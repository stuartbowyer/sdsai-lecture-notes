        "**Objective:**\n",
        "Write a Python script to filter a list of patient IDs, ranging from 1 to 1,000. The script should output a final list of IDs eligible for a specific clinical program.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Requirements:**\n",
        "The script must iterate through IDs from 1 to 1,000 (inclusive) and exclude IDs based on the following rules:\n",
        "1.  The ID is a multiple of 4.\n",
        "2.  The final digit of the ID is 7.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Suggested Approach:**\n",
        "1.  Take a look at the 'range' function.\n",
        "2.  Loop through the full range of patient IDs.\n",
        "3.  For each ID, apply conditional logic to check if it meets either of the exclusion criteria.\n",
        "4.  The modulo operator (`%`) is effective for identifying multiples.\n",
        "5.  To check the final digit, consider the different ways Python can handle numbers, such as type conversion to a string.\n",
        "6.  Print only the IDs that do not meet any exclusion criteria."
