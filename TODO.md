# TODO
Changes that are needed to the course material or ideas for general improvements

## 1 / Programming for DS and AI
*   Possibly add the logic tables when introducing `and` and `or` - maybe just draw them live?

## 2 / 
*   Too much material, need more space for practice/exercises
*   Examples are not showing in slides

## 3 / ML Foundations and Data Prep
*   Too much material
*   Data standardisation/normalisation is hard to justify without having seen how a basic model works
*   In exercise 3.1 - clarify what is meant by variation/variability
