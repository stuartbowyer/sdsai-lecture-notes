        "## Computing Average CRP Values\n",
        "\n",
        "You have been given the (fake) data of five patients' C-Reactive Protein (CRP) tests.  \n",
        "Write a function that computes and returns the **average (mean) CRP value** for a given **patient of interest (POI)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each patient has multiple CRP values recorded in the dataset, and all of the values are mixed together randomly.  \n",
        "To identify which value belongs to which patient, you are also given an aligned list of patient names.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",
        "\n",
        "The first four entries of the CRP value list, `crp`, look like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "crp = ['0.0 mg/L', '0.1301 mg/L', '1.4855 mg/L', '0.6009 mg/L', ...]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "And the first four entries of the patient list, `patients`, look like this:\n",

        "```python\n",
        "patients = ['Liam', 'Emma', 'Oliver', 'Oliver', ...]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that:\n",
        "- The first value (`0.0 mg/L`) was from *Liam*  \n",
        "- The second (`0.1301 mg/L`) was from *Emma*  \n",
        "- The third (`1.4855 mg/L`) and fourth (`0.6009 mg/L`) were from *Oliver*\n",
        "\n",
        "### Additional Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "Your function should:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Be called **`average_crp`**  \n",
        "- Take **three inputs**:  \n",
        "  `crp` (the full list of CRP values),  \n",
        "  `patients` (the full list of patient names associated with the values),  \n",
        "  and `poi` (the name of a single patient of interest)  \n",
        "- **Return the average CRP value** that patient `poi` has in the dataset  \n",
        "\n",
        "You do **not** need to use any additional Python modules to complete this exercise.  \n",
        "You will learn how to do this more efficiently with external libraries (e.g., `pandas`) later.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Notes\n",
        "- This exercise helps you practise **writing and using functions** in Python.  \n",
        "- It also reinforces how to **associate related data** across lists.  \n",
        "- You could try and extend this to identify “elevated” CRP tests (i.e. those test greater than 1 mg/L above mean) once you are comfortable with these ideas.\n"
