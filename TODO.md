# TODO
Changes that are needed to the course material or ideas for general improvements

## 1 / Programming for DS and AI
*   Add some worked examples
*   Possibly add the logic tables when introducing `and` and `or` - maybe just draw them live?
*   Remove modulo example and replace with something more straight forward
*   Add a new early exercise to just explore creating variables etc before getting into control flow

## 2 / Manipulating and Visualising Data
*   For the CRP example, it would be clearer for explanation and testing to just pick a name and run the function rather than using a loop

## 3 / ML Foundations and Data Prep
*   Need to simplify the MIMIC access, too many issues with different versions and projects. This should be standardised and simplified.
*   Start with a simpler example for the MEWS, perhaps hint about the use of cut with labels
